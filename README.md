# Design Patterns Repository

Welcome to the Design Patterns Repository! This repository contains a 
collection of small programs showcasing various design patterns 
implemented in Java.

## About Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. 
They provide proven approaches to solve specific design challenges, making 
software development more efficient and maintainable.

## Repository Structure

Each design pattern implementation is organized in its own directory. 
Inside each directory, you will find the source code files for the 
respective design pattern, along with a README file providing a detailed 
explanation and usage instructions.

## Available Design Patterns

- Simple Factory
- Singleton

Feel free to explore the directories and learn more about each design 
pattern implementation.

## Usage

To run the code examples and see the patterns in action, follow these 
steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/hamdaouis/design-patterns.git

2. Navigate to the directory of the desired design pattern implementation.

3. Compile the Java files using the appropriate compiler command.

4. Run the main class of the program to observe the pattern in action.

## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have implemented a 
design pattern in Java and would like to share it with others, feel free 
to submit a pull request. Please make sure to follow the repository's 
guidelines and maintain the consistent structure.
