# Design Patterns Repository

Welcome to the Design Patterns Repository! This repository contains a 
collection of small programs showcasing various design patterns 
implemented in Java.

## About Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems. 
They provide proven approaches to solve specific design challenges, making 
software development more efficient and maintainable.

## Repository Structure

Each design pattern implementation is organized in its own directory. 
Inside each directory, you will find the source code files for the 
respective design pattern, along with a README file providing a detailed 
explanation and usage instructions.

## Available Design Patterns

- Simple Factory
- Singleton

Feel free to explore the directories and learn more about each design 
pattern implementation.

## Usage

This repository contains different branches, each representing a different 
design pattern implementation. Follow the steps below to access a specific 
design pattern:

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/hamdaouis/design-patterns.git
=======
1. Clone the repository: `git clone 
https://github.com/hamdaouis/design-patterns.git`
>>>>>>> 239a13b (Update README.md)

2. Fetch all the branches: `git fetch --all`

3. Switch to the desired branch: `git checkout <branch-name>`

Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch corresponding to the 
design pattern you want to explore. You can find the list of available 
branches using the command `git branch -a`.

Feel free to explore the different branches and their respective design 
pattern implementations.

 ## Contributions

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have implemented a 
design pattern in Java and would like to share it with others, feel free 
to submit a pull request. Please make sure to follow the repository's 
guidelines and maintain the consistent structure.
